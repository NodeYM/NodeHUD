Install unzip the file and copy the 'NodeHUD-master' folder into steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom

Make sure you install ALL the fonts in the resource folder and in the resource/ui folder there are many fonts due to the fact that parts of this hud have been borrowed from other popular huds
